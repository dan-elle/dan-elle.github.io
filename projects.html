            </a>
            <p>Created for UOFTHacks X, Journa is a journalling app designed to aid with
                self-exploration and mood-tracking. The app was written in JavaScript and React Native in less than 36
                hours with a team of four, all of whom had never used React Native before. Currently, the user is able
                to add a journal to the app daily and receive a quote daily. Additional functionalities are planned
                to be added to the app in the future, such as cloud-stored account information, a notification system,
                and an updated user interface. The project in its current state can be accessed through the title above.

            </a>
            <p>Created for NewHacks 2022, Productive Pet is a web extension designed to work in Chromium based browsers.
                The extension was built in JavaScript and was my first project written in the language. Currently, the
                user is able to add their tasks to the extension and create a checklist. Future functionalities will
                include a points system that can be used to upgrade your pet and social connectivity to allow for
                competition between friends. The project in its current state can be accessed through the title above.</p>
