        <h3 class="popout_text container">Hello World!</h3>
        <p class="content container">I'm a first-year student in the computer engineering program at the University of
            Toronto planning to specialize in the software stream. Currently, I work in HTML, CSS, Python, and C. I have
            a bit of experience in using MATLAB and am learning how to work in JavaScript. After graduating, I hope to
            work in software, potentially in cyber security or software development.<br> <br>
            As a student, I am constantly looking for ways to get involved in my school community. This year, I was
            selected to be the Events Coordinator for the First Year Council (affiliated with EngSoc at the University
            of Toronto). I also participated in a design team during my first year called Robots for Space Exploration
            (RSX) where I learned about how my programming experience can be applied to more physical projects, such as
            the rover that is being built by the team.<br> <br>
            Outside of programming, I love spending time learning new hobbies and playing instruments. My current
            favourite hobby is crocheting and my favourite instrument is the violin. I also enjoy photography. All of
            the pictures posted on this site were taken by me!</p>
